The website is further populated with data from the OpenWeather API and this API is accessed every 15 minutes for up-to-date weather information. The graphs are drawn with Chart.js. The website is hosted locally on an ODROID C4 running Ubuntu. At the end of the day, an email is automatically sent with the day's production.",
